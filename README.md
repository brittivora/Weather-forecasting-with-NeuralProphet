# Weather-forecasting-with-NeuralProphet
This project demonstrates time series forecasting of weather data using the NeuralProphet library. NeuralProphet is a powerful time series forecasting library that combines neural networks and classical forecasting methods.

# Data Preparation
Load weather data from a CSV file
Preprocess the data (handle missing values, convert date format, etc.)

# Model Training
Create a NeuralProphet model instance
Train the model on the prepared data

# Forecasting
Create a future DataFrame for forecasting
Generate the forecast using the trained model

# Visualization
Plot the forecast
Plot the components of the forecast (trend, yearly seasonality, weekly seasonality)

# Saving the trained model for future use
